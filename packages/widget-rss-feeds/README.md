## Usage

This widget is a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) that uses [`preact-habitat`](https://github.com/zouhir/preact-habitat/) to render inside an existing HTML page. Begin by building a bundle:

```
$ pwd  # ~/tracking-exposed
$ yarn install
$ yarn bootstrap
$ yarn compile:widgets
```

To deploy to a server, use the provided [`index.html`](./index.html) or replicate the integration  in an existing HTML page by following the structure of the file. The HTML page has to fetch the following external dependencies:

- The `tachyons` CSS library.
- The `preact` JS library.

See [`index.html`](./index.html) for example snippets.

The following files must be copied:

- `index.html`
- `bundle/*`

and supply the `all-entities.json` file that gets generated by `processor-entities` in the same directory as the `index.html`.

Alternatively copy the require JSON file and run a simple HTTP server with `packages/widget-rss-feeds` as root:

```
npx serve   # This will open a local HTTP server on port 5000
```
